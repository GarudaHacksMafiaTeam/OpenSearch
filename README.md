## Inspiration

Software Development is one of the most growing fields in the last 50 years. It creates work for countless people while at the same time helping countless people simplify their work and procedures. And the influence it made in the last decade has been revolutionary for all industries.

The best way to learn software development is through real-life projects, especially open-source projects. Unfortunately, most beginner software developers find it difficult to contribute to real-life projects that they would like to build together.

Here we build OpenSearch, a platform that allows user to build their own personal opensource project, manage their opensource task, and even let them find any opensource project that they would like to join so they could level up their skills.

## Our Features:

### Explore
Explore our curated list of open source projects. You can also find one you like to contribute to.

### Feeds
See updates from an open source project. Contributors can also leave like and comments in the feeds.

### Crowdfunding
Even though open source projects are free to use, they also need funding for maintenance.
