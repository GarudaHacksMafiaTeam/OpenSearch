# OpenSearch

> A Collaboration Platform for Open Source Projects. 

## Inspiration

Software Development is one of the most growing fields in the last 50 years. It creates work for countless people while at the same time helping countless people simplify their work and procedures. And the influence it made in the last decade has been revolutionary for all industries.

The best way to learn software development is through real-life projects, especially open-source projects. Unfortunately, most beginner software developers find it difficult to contribute to real-life projects that they would like to build together.

Here we build OpenSearch, a platform that allows user to build their own personal opensource project, manage their opensource task, and even let them find any opensource project that they would like to join so they could level up their skills.

## Features

### Explore
Explore our curated list of open source projects. You can also find one you like to contribute to.

### Feeds
See updates from an open source project. Contributors can also leave like and comments in the feeds.

### Crowdfunding
Even though open source projects are free to use, they also need funding for maintenance. Crowdfunding sections provide payment methods for contributors to help open source fundings.

### RFC
Organize tasks and collaborate with other open source contributors.

## How we built it
First, we brainstormed together and found solution to the topic, then we collaborate to do the UI/UX design using Figma, database schema, and develop it with Next.js. We often have online meets to discuss through the project. For development, we use  [fullstack starter with next-auth, prisma, next.js and graphql-shield](https://github.com/wangel13/prisma-next-auth-graphql-starter) by [wangel13](https://github.com/wangel13) as our starter template. After that, we execute our plan for development.

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge for us was to complete the app in around 36 hours. Beside that, learning Next.js and GraphQL while building the projects was also quite a challenge for us.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to make a solution to help developing open source community and complete the MVP for our project from design until product.

## What we learned
After 36 hours building this project. We  learned a lot about Next.js and some new frameworks and tools like GraphQL, Prisma, and front-end design.

## What's next?
In the future, we hope that we could put deploy OpenSearch to public and help lots of people to collaborate in Open-Source Projects.
